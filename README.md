# ImageSqueezer
Ever wondered to have an application which imports media automatically, scales them down to a desired size and return them back to the app meant to send them? You won't have to care about problems like underlying the 25Mb email size, or infinite sending times of chat apps anymore, since ImageSqueezer acts as a (benevolent) app-in-the-middle!
